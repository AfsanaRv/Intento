# Intento

Intento is a web-based project management application. By using this application users will be able to create and manage their projects. Users will be able to create different “projects” where they will set their goals and update the percentage they have completed.  Users can also “Favorite” a project that will be shown on top of their profiles. Users can also create “teams”. The user who creates the team will be the team leader. A leader can add or remove other users. Teams can have multiple projects, and at least two users. Additionally, a team can be assigned to a project by the leader. A project can have multiple users and teams. The “Projects” will have “Intents” which can contain zero to multiple “Tasks”.
